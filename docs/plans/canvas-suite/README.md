# coSlash Canvas Suite Migration Package

This directory is the coordination package for migrating Session Canvas, DaGama Canvas, and Atlas Canvas from Fleetlog commit `c13a3ef01438193dcdcd2e387300e69ae3c27437` into a branch based on the latest `centauri-ai/coslash/main`.

The package currently lives in the legacy source repository because no standalone coSlash checkout was available when it was created. Before implementation, the master agent must copy this directory unchanged into `docs/plans/canvas-suite/` on the coSlash integration branch `hlu/canvas-migration`.

## Read first

1. [MASTER_PLAN.md](MASTER_PLAN.md)
2. [AUTOMATION.md](AUTOMATION.md)
3. [CONTRACTS.md](CONTRACTS.md)
4. [FILE_OWNERSHIP.md](FILE_OWNERSHIP.md)
5. [MASTER_AGENT.md](MASTER_AGENT.md)
6. The assigned file under [tasks/](tasks/) and its matching file under `task-status/`.

## Central monitoring files

- [STATUS.md](STATUS.md): current task, branch, agent, dependency, and verification state.
- [REPORTS.md](REPORTS.md): append-only summaries of completed or paused agent turns.
- [ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md): newly discovered bugs, risks, blockers, and follow-up work.
- [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md): decisions that change contracts, scope, ordering, or behavior.
- [ACCEPTANCE.md](ACCEPTANCE.md): product and release gates.

Only the master agent edits these central monitoring files. Workers report using the template embedded in every task file; the master records that report centrally. This avoids merge conflicts between parallel worktrees.

Live task state is automatic: each assigned agent exclusively updates `task-status/NN.js` plus its own task brief according to [AUTOMATION.md](AUTOMATION.md). `migration-control.html` loads those files directly and refreshes every 15 seconds, so the human operator does not re-enter worker status.

## Execution waves

```text
Wave 0:  00 reference baseline  ||  01 plugin contracts
Wave 1:  02 core registration   ||  03 runfs  ||  04 terminal  ||  06 detail  ||  07 UI shell
Wave 2:  05 git/artifacts       ||  08 persistence
Wave 3:  09/10 Session Canvas   ||  11 DaGama model  ||  14 Atlas model
Wave 4:  12/13 DaGama           ||  15/16 Atlas      ||  17 legacy import
Wave 5:  18 security, E2E, release hardening
Wave 6:  19 final integration
```

With four available agent slots, the master remains active and runs at most three worker tasks concurrently.

## Safety rules

- Do not merge the unrelated Fleetlog and coSlash histories.
- Do not implement on `main`.
- Treat Fleetlog as a read-only behavioral reference after its source commit is archived.
- Do not expose incomplete Canvas destinations.
- Do not perform real pushes, PR creation, or destructive cleanup during normal tests.
- Do not let workers edit shared integration files or central monitoring documents.
